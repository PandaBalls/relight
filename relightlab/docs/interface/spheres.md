#Reflective spheres

<!-- we need you to find the sphere, click on the boundary (minimum is 3), to mark the sphere
points can be removed (select it click delete) or dragged around.
When done the reflections will be automatically computed.
You can re-edit the points later (edit button), verify and eventually manually adjust the
reflections -->
