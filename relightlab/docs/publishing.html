<h2>Publishing RTI on the Web</h2>

<p>RelightLab provides the creation and web publishing of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) datasets: 
a dataset consists of metadata stored in a JSON  file along with several large coefficient images that define the relighting model.</p>

<h3>Image Format and Storage</h3>
<p>RTI images are better stored in a <b>pyramidal tile format</b>, similar to DeepZoom, Zoomify, or Google Maps tiles. This approach provides:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Progressive loading</b>, enabling fast previews before full resolution is available.
    <li><b>Efficient zooming and panning</b>, reducing bandwidth and memory usage.
    <li><b>Better compatibility</b> with existing web visualization frameworks.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Hosting Challenges</h3>
Hosting RTI datasets presents several difficulties:
<ul>
    <li><b>File Transfer Bottlenecks</b>: Large datasets consist of thousands of small tile files, leading to slow transfer speeds and inefficiencies.
    <li><b>Filesystem Limitations</b>: The number of inodes (file system entries) required for thousands of tiles can become a limiting factor.
    <li><b>Network Overhead</b>: Web servers may struggle with the large number of HTTP requests needed to load tile-based images.
    <li><b>DDoS Protection Triggers</b>: A large number of requests from a single user might be interpreted as an attack, leading to unintentional 
blocking by security filters.
</ul>

<h3>Tarzoom: Compacting Tiles</h3>
<p>To address these issues, <b>Tarzoom</b> offers a more efficient way to store RTI dataset tiles. Instead of keeping thousands of individual files, 
it packs all image tiles of a coefficient plane into a <b>single archive file</b> with an index. It reduces the number of files per plane to just two.
Datasets become much more manageable and somewhat smaller.</p>


<h3>Limitations of Tarzoom</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Partial Content Requests (HTTP 206)</b>: Some web servers and CDNs do not support partial downloads of large files, limiting compatibility with Tarzoom.
    <li>DeepZoom Dependency</b>: Due to the lack of universal support for HTTP 206 partial requests, DeepZoom remains the primary tiling format.
</ul>

<h3>Itarzoom: Optimizing Tile Retrieval</h3>

<p>To further improve performance, <b>Itarzoom</b> introduces a <b>single-request</b> mechanism that downloads all the tiles for a given region in one request.
It reduces the number of server interactions, lowering the risk of triggering DDoS protections.</p>
