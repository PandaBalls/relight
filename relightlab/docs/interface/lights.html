<h2>Lights geometry</h2>

<p>Many RTI software consider the light direction only, as if the lights were infinitely distant,
this approximation is somewhat ok for a visual inspection, but severely distorts the normals.
We can instead take into account for each pixel the real light direction if we can reconstruct
the geometry of the scene: 3d positions of the lights and size of the image </p>


<p>If the images are captured using a dome, you can provide the light directions/positions to relightlab
instead of using reflective spheres.
You can use an <a href="formats/lp.html">.lp file</a> (see formats/lp.md</p>
