## Reinstate existing functions:

* initialize from .relight spheres, or dome.
* rti creation and export
* lp saving
* normals saving and filtering/flattening
* image scale measuring

## New Features

* consider eventual modifications to the file format to mirror interface parameters.
* manual alignment
* ellipse reflections geometrically accurate

## Long term new features

* preprocessing files and caching
* TIF/CR2/JPEGXL support
* floating point processing
* shadow and burned pixels filtering
* Assisted/automated alignment
* PBR texture creation


## Small Bugs

* Check version is properly written and read from the .relight file
