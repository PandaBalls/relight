4. <a href="#normals"> Export normals </a>

##New project

<!-- relight save the configuration in a .relight project. To creata a project select a folder where the all the images
are (in .jpg format) -->


##Light configuration

<!-- relight needs to know the position/direction of the lights, here we proporse to use an .lp if
present or to use a reflective sphere -->

##Export RTI

<!-- we instruct the user to crop the region of interest, than to select a simple ptm (link to rti/basis.md), 
  save in web image format, -->


#Working with normals

<!-- we can exporta a normalmap, ensure that the normal is flat (see interface/geometry.md), 
and export also a mesh (.ply) or a depthmap -->

#Explore the results

<!-- in the queue tab open the folder to see the images, cast to see the openlime viewer -->
