Compilers: I have only manage to compile using visual studio 2017 (because of Qt problems).
In case the compiler complains about a v142 tool, you can change it in the project (right click on the project) properties.

The libraries (jpeg and armadillo) are supposed to be found on the same level as the relight repository.


LibJpeg: https://github.com/winlibs/libjpeg/releases

The following line in makefile.vc needs to be commented (installing win32.mak looks complicated and unnecessary)

#!include <win32.mak>

Run this line from cmd.exe, will create a jpeg.sln.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.16.27023\bin\Hostx64\x64\nmake.exe" /f makefile.vc setup-v16

In case something is wrong you might have to remove the dir and start anew.

Open the jpeg.sln in visual studio, remember to select 64x release.



Armadillo: http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html

Open the folder (file -> open folder) with armadillo, it will process the cmake files, build.

Lapack and blas lib and dll are well hidden in examples/lib_64, the dlls must be copied in relight/bin.
