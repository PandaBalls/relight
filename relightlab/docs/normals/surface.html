#Generate a 3D surface

<!-- Normal maps can be integrated to create a 3d surface. This process has two main limitations: 
one is error accumulation, the other is dealing with discontinuties -->

##Fourier normal integration

<!-- cannot properly deal with discontinuities, it is dense (large meshes, 2 triangles per pixel), and very fast -->

##Bilateral normal integration

<!-- can deal with discontinuties (there is a parameter that basically control the probability
a sudden change in normal is marked as a discontinuity), it is dense, it is very slow -->

#Adaptive surface meshing
<!-- cannot deal with discontinuities but the resulting mesh is reasonably small. Slow.
A parameter controls the precision of the output -->
