<h2>Image list</h2>

<p>The image tab allows you to explore the photos.</p>

<p>You can have the list of the images and a single image shown or you can see the all the images at once using the icons on the top right</p>

<p>A checkbox for each photo is checkable and when not checked the image is not considered part of the dataset: if you load a file containing the light directions the application requires the number of checked images to be equal to the number of lights in the <a href="interface/lights.html">.lp file or dome</a>.</p>

<p>An 'eye' icon on the right of the file name is used instead to remove some images from the computation of RTI's and normals.</p>

<p>You can also select the images clicking on the images (shift and control click allows you to select multiple images) and rotate them all at once using the 'rotate' icons.</p>
