<h2> RTI Basis </h2>

<p>Generic introduction to RTI: a linear combination of basis functions, be it polinomial
spherical harmonics, or custom interpolated bases.</p>

<h3>Which basis?</h3>

<p><b>Material:</b> (dull (lambertian)) vs. reflective, translucent etc, each basis 
and number of <a href="rti/coefficients.html">coefficients</a> has a different capability
of reproducing materials with complex light interaction<br/>
PTM is really bad at reproducing reflective materials, RBF/BLN are the best.</p>

<p><b>Light sampling:</b> datasets captured with light manually placed might leave certain light
directions underepresented. The basis functions will have to interpolate the light function and
the type of interpolation yelds different results. PTM and HSH are very robust, while RBF and BLN
will result in 'jerky' light changes when exploring the interpolated region.</p>

<p><b>Format:</b> RTIViewer supports only PTM and HSH basis, while the <a href="rti/web.html">web formats</a> support all of the basis</p>

<p><b>Per pixel light direction:</b> a common approximation assumes the light direction is the same for all the pixels.
This results in a 'spotlight' reproduction and warped normals. If you allow RelightLab to reconstruct the <a href="interface/lights.html">geometry of the scene</a> (light positions
in 3d, image size, etc), it will be able to compensate for light intensity and direction for each pixel.
Unfortunately, RBF does not support this feature</p>
