<h2>Scale</h2>

<p>We can specify a segment on the image and assign a lenght in millimiters. This will be
used for taking measurements in the viewer, once the RTI has been generated.</p>

<p>Click the 'Set new scale measurement...' button and click on the edges of the segment 
you know the lenght off, then enter the measurement in mm.</p>

<p>Pixel size and image with and height will be computed.</p>l

<p>Image width will be needed if you are planning to use the posistion of the light in 3D
in order to correct, per pixel, light direction and intensity. See <a href="interface/lights.html">Lights tab documentation</a>.</p>
